# Electronics control

## Idea

this is where inputs like the user's voice, gestures, or other forms of user input are processed and interpreted to determine the system's physical response.  
Inputs may include:

- Voice commands (e.g. "turn on the lights")
- Gestures (e.g. hand or finger movements)
- Keystrokes (e.g. typing on a keyboard)
- Biometric data (e.g. facial recognition)
- Environmental data (e.g. temperature, humidity, light levels)

## File Paths

    electronics_/                   # Controls inputs
     ├── electronics.md             # Description of the 'input_contol' directory
     └── main.rs                    # central file. Electronics components hopefully will be written in rust. maybe C++
