# Memory

## Idea

This is where major details will me held. maybe in a SQLite data-based or a .txt/.csv file

Major memories will influence the returned text from voice_output/text_response.py

## File Paths

    input_control/                  # Controls inputs
     ├── input_control.md           # Description of the 'input_contol' directory
     ├── command_normalisation.py   # determination and normalisation of commands
     ├── emotional_analysis.py     # determination of emotion and tone
     └── speech_to_text.py          # speech to tech via openAI whisper
